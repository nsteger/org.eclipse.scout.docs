== ObjectType as Class Reference (Scout JS)
It is now possible to use a class reference as `objectType`.
An `objectType` is typically used when creating a new object using `scout.create(objectType)` or when defining a model.
Using a class reference instead of a string will make the development easier because the IDE knows about the actual type and can provide
code completion or and other assistance.

It may even improve the tree shaking process of the bundler (webpack).
Because using a class reference requires an `import`, the bundler automatically includes the imported module.

So,
[source, js]
----
scout.create('Button', {parent: this});
----

becomes this:

[source, js]
----
import {Button} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

scout.create(Button, {parent: this});
----

And this
[source, js]
----
export default () => ({
  objectType: 'Form',
  rootGroupBox: {
    objectType: 'GroupBox'
  }
});
----

becomes this:

[source, js]
----
import {Form, GroupBox} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

export default () => ({
  objectType: Form,
  rootGroupBox: {
    objectType: GroupBox
  }
});
----
